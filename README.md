# Portfolio Website with React, Gatsby, and Strapi CMS

Welcome to the README for your portfolio website! This project utilizes React for the frontend, Gatsby as the static site generator, and Strapi as the content management system (CMS) to help you easily manage and update your portfolio content.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Gatsby CLI: Install globally using npm with `npm install -g gatsby-cli`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-portfolio.git
cd your-portfolio
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

#### Strapi CMS

1. Set up your Strapi CMS by following the installation guide on the [Strapi documentation](https://strapi.io/documentation/v3.x/getting-started/introduction.html).

2. Create your content types in Strapi to represent your portfolio items (e.g., projects, blog posts, skills).

3. Populate your content types with data through the Strapi admin interface.

4. Adjust the GraphQL queries in the Gatsby project (`src/pages/index.js` and other relevant files) to match your content structure.

#### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the Gatsby project and add the following variables:

```env
STRAPI_API_URL=your-strapi-api-url
```

Replace `your-strapi-api-url` with the URL where your Strapi API is hosted (e.g., `http://localhost:1337`).

### Running the Application

Start the Gatsby development server:

```bash
gatsby develop
```

Your portfolio should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Customization

### Styling

This project uses [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling. Update the styles in the `src/styles` directory to match your branding and preferences.

### Components

Customize the React components in the `src/components` directory to tailor the layout and structure of your portfolio.

### Deployment

Deploy your Gatsby site to hosting services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. Ensure you update your environment variables accordingly for production.
